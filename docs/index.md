# Automate More, Worry Less

![Inside Macpaint by Ken Jenkins](/automation-workshop/assets/inside-macpaint.jpeg)

Pushing code doesn’t have to be scary. We'll explore ways to embrace automation to write better code and everything that happens after: testing, refactoring, code quality, and deployments. You'll learn about refactoring tools like Rector, and code quality/static analysis tools like PHPStan, ECS, Prettier, and Husky. We'll cover how to integrate these tools with PhpStorm and automate them with Github Actions, so they run and report back to you and enable you to move on with your life.
